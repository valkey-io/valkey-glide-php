# Welcome to Valkey GLIDE PHP!

Valkey General Language Independent Driver for the Enterprise (GLIDE) is the official open-source Valkey client library, proudly part of the Valkey organization. Our mission is to make your experience with Valkey and Redis OSS seamless and enjoyable. Whether you're a seasoned developer or just starting out, Valkey GLIDE is here to support you every step of the way.

**`valkey-glide-php`** is the PHP binding for Valkey GLIDE. It brings the power and flexibility of the Valkey GLIDE core to the PHP ecosystem, with a familiar and convenient interface based on the popular [PHPRedis](https://github.com/phpredis/phpredis) API. By staying mostly API-compatible with PHPRedis, this client offers an easy migration path and minimal learning curve—while adding the features of Valkey GLIDE.

> We chose [PHPRedis](https://github.com/phpredis/phpredis) because it is a powerful and widely adopted Redis client for PHP.

⚠️ **Note:** This client is currently under active development. Not all features are available yet, but a public preview with a subset of core functionality will be released soon.

# Why Choose Valkey GLIDE?

- **Community and Open Source**: Join our vibrant community and contribute to the project. We are always here to respond, and the client is for the community.
- **Reliability**: Built with best practices learned from over a decade of operating Redis OSS-compatible services.
- **Performance**: Optimized for high performance and low latency.
- **High Availability**: Designed to ensure your applications are always up and running.
- **Cross-Language Support**: Implemented using a core driver framework written in Rust, with language-specific extensions to ensure consistency and reduce complexity.
- **Stability and Fault Tolerance**: We brought our years of experience to create a bulletproof client.
- **Backed and Supported by AWS and GCP**: Ensuring robust support and continuous improvement of the project.

## Key Features
- **[Cluster-Aware MGET/MSET/DEL/FLUSHALL](https://github.com/valkey-io/valkey-glide/wiki/General-Concepts#multi-slot-command-handling:~:text=Multi%2DSlot%20Command%20Execution,JSON.MGET)** – Execute multi-key commands across cluster slots without manual key grouping.
- **[Cluster Scan](https://github.com/valkey-io/valkey-glide/wiki/General-Concepts#cluster-scan)** – Unified key iteration across shards using a consistent, high-level API for cluster environments.

## Installation and Setup

### Prerequisites

Before installing Valkey GLIDE PHP extension, ensure you have the following dependencies:

- PHP development headers (`php-dev` or `php-devel`)
- Build tools (`gcc`, `make`, `autotools`)
- Git
- pkg-config
- protoc (protobuf compiler) >= v3.20.0
- openssl and openssl-dev
- rustup (Rust toolchain)

### Installing Dependencies

**Ubuntu/Debian:**
```bash
sudo apt update -y
sudo apt install -y php-dev php-cli git gcc make autotools-dev pkg-config openssl libssl-dev unzip
# Install rust
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
source "$HOME/.cargo/env"
```

**CentOS/RHEL:**
```bash
sudo yum update -y
sudo yum install -y php-devel php-cli git gcc make pkgconfig openssl openssl-devel unzip
# Install rust
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
source "$HOME/.cargo/env"
```

**macOS:**
```bash
brew update
brew install php git gcc make pkgconfig protobuf openssl
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
source "$HOME/.cargo/env"
```

### Installing protobuf compiler

**For macOS:**
```bash
brew install protobuf
brew install protobuf-c
# Verify installation
protoc --version
```

**For Linux:**
```bash
PB_REL="https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/releases"
curl -LO $PB_REL/download/v3.20.3/protoc-3.20.3-linux-x86_64.zip
unzip protoc-3.20.3-linux-x86_64.zip -d $HOME/.local
export PATH="$PATH:$HOME/.local/bin"
# Verify installation (minimum version 3.20.0 required)
protoc --version
```

### Building and Installing the Extension

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/valkey-io/valkey-glide-php.git
    cd valkey-glide-php
    ```

2. Initialize submodules (if not cloned with --recurse-submodules):
    ```bash
    git submodule update --init --recursive
    ```

3. Build the FFI library (required dependency):
    ```bash
    python3 utils/remove_optional_from_proto.py
    cd valkey-glide/ffi
    cargo build --release
    cd ../../
    ```

4. Build the extension:
    ```bash
    phpize
    ./configure --enable-valkey-glide
    make build-modules-pre
    make install
    ```

5. Enable the extension by adding it to your `php.ini` file:
    ```ini
    extension=valkey_glide
    ```
   
6. Generate PHP protobuf classes used for testing purposes:
   ```bash
   protoc --proto_path=./valkey-glide/glide-core/src/protobuf --php_out=./tests/ ./valkey-glide/glide-core/src/protobuf/connection_request.proto
   ```

7. Install PHP dependencies with composer:
   ```bash
   composer install --no-interaction --prefer-dist --optimize-autoloader
   ```

8. Execute the tests:
    ```
    make test
    ```
## Basic Examples

### Standalone Valkey:

```php
<?php
try {
    // Create client configuration
    $addresses = [
        ['host' => 'localhost', 'port' => 6379]
    ];
    
    // Create ValkeyGlide client
    $client = new ValkeyGlide(
        $addresses,                       // addresses
        false,                            // use_tls
        null,                             // credentials  
    );
    
    // Basic operations
    $setResult = $client->set('foo', 'bar');
    echo "SET result: " . $setResult . "\n";
    
    $getValue = $client->get('foo');
    echo "GET result: " . $getValue . "\n";
    
    $pingResult = $client->ping();
    echo "PING result: " . $pingResult . "\n";
    
    // Close the connection
    $client->close();
    
} catch (Exception $e) {
    echo "Error: " . $e->getMessage() . "\n";
}
?>
```

### Cluster Valkey:

```php
<?php
try {
    // Create cluster client configuration
    $addresses = [
        ['host' => 'localhost', 'port' => 7001],
        ['host' => 'localhost', 'port' => 7002],
        ['host' => 'localhost', 'port' => 7003]
    ];
    
    // Create ValkeyGlideCluster client
    $client = new ValkeyGlideCluster(
        $addresses,                          // addresses
        false,                               // use_tls
